# Readme

- `kubo-client` plan is the only one currently working. It is capable of connecting to EIPFS and retrieve a file.
- `js-ipfs-client` doesn't have outbound internal access. Testground SDK currently doesn't provide a way of overriding this behaviour.
- `libp2p-client` didn't work and it's here only for historical purposes.
